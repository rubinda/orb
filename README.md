# ORB - keypoint detection and matching

This repository holds an attempt to implement ORB based on the original paper. Some implementation details 
(e.g. machine learning a keypoint detector) have been omitted.

The code is not very fast, but it somewhat performs according to expectations.
To see some examples of what it can do check out my [report](report/porocilo_rubin.pdf) (written in Slovene).
